Hello,

If you want to reach out to me for work-related topics, ask for some insights or for a cup of coffee or beer, feel free to reach out to using social media or shoot me an email to `contact[at]cmpsoares.com`.

I hope to develop a sort of contact form in the near future, but it's still on the TODO List. ;-)

Hope to hear from you soon.

Carlos Soares.
