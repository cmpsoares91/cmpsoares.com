Well, I always dreamed of creating a blog, writing my own technical endeavourings for other technician, engineers and curious minds to read. However, I must say it has been my most procrastinated goal ever. But after getting a taste of it at my last job (unfortunately, it wasn’t publicly available) I believe this time it will be it.

So I’ll see you soon with hopefully with content that’d you’ll love or find of great use.
